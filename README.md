## Setup

First, if you want to ensure you're using the correct Node.js and package manager versions, use nvm

```sh
# install Node
nvm install node 17.0.0
nvm use 17.0.0
```

Then, check out a local copy of this repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mike-north/full-stack-ts
cd full-stack-typescript
```

Next, install the project dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

Build the project for the first time

```sh
yarn build
```

And finally, start the project

```sh
yarn dev
```

After the client and server build processes complete, you should see an "imitation Twitter" running on [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).
